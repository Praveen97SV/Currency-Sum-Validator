Pywarrior - Minimum count of money bills required to equal the user money amount.
Description- Create a function bill_count that takes two arguments. 
The first argument is the amount of money the user has and the second is the list of money bills available. 
Return the minimum count of money bills required to equal the user money amount.

The key is to verify the input arguments, such that 
1) Amount of money is greater than 
2) List of Money Bills available because the vice versa is an invalid condition. 
Also make sure that there are no negative value inputs and the List of Money Bills are to be taken from Standard Indian Currency System.
